        We collect information that you provide directly to us, such as when you
        create an account, post content, or contact us. This may include your
        name, email address, and other contact details. We also collect certain
        information automatically when you use our services, like your IP

        information provided by Google APIs as per the permissions granted.

      <h2>How We Use Collected Information</h2>
      <p>
        The information we collect is used to provide, maintain, and improve our
        services. We may use your information to communicate with you, such as
        sending service updates, responding to inquiries, or notifying you about
        changes in our policies. Information obtained through Google APIs is

      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with third
        parties only in ways that are described in this privacy policy, such as
        with service providers who assist us in our operations or in response to
        legal requests. Any data received from Google APIs is handled with
        strict confidentiality and is not shared with unauthorized parties.

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
        your personal information. However, no system can be completely secure,
        and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Data
        accessed through Google APIs is subject to additional security measures
        to ensure its protection.
